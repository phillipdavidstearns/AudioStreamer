# AudioStreamer

Simple audio streaming application using TCP/UDP in python

The client and server code for the audio streaming application utilizes a network programming approach 
with sockets to transmit audio data between a client and a server:

## Architecture Overview

This audio streaming application is designed around a client-server architecture that enables 
real-time audio streaming over the network. The application supports both UDP and TCP protocols for 
data transmission, providing flexibility in balancing between lower latency (UDP) and reliable data transmission (TCP).

## Server

Module Dependencies: Uses the socket, argparse, signal, pyaudio, and sys modules.

### Functionality:

The server initializes a socket connection on a specified port and listens for incoming audio streams from the client.
It uses the pyaudio library to play the incoming audio stream in real-time.
A signal handler is implemented to gracefully shut down the server on receiving 
a SIGINT signal, ensuring that resources are properly released.

## Client

Module Dependencies: Similar to the server, it utilizes the socket, argparse, signal, pyaudio, sys, 
and additionally, the queue module for buffering audio data.

### Functionality:

The client captures audio input from a microphone using the pyaudio library.
Audio data is then sent to the server over a socket connection, either using UDP or TCP, based on the user's choice.
Implements a signal handler to intercept SIGINT signals for a graceful shutdown, closing the socket and releasing resources properly.

## Key Features

Flexibility in Protocol Choice: The application can be configured to use either UDP or TCP for audio 
data transmission, offering a trade-off between speed and reliability.
Real-Time Audio Streaming: Leverages the pyaudio library for capturing and playing audio in 
real-time, facilitating live audio streaming over the network.
Graceful Shutdown: Both the client and server are equipped with signal handlers to manage
unexpected exits, ensuring that resources are not left hanging.

## Installation

### Raspberry Pi
  
* `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-dev portaudio19-dev`

## Usage

Both the client and server scripts accept command-line arguments to specify the protocol (--protocol with options udp or tcp).
The server must be started before the client and set to listen on a specific port.
The client then connects to the server's IP address and port, beginning the audio stream.
